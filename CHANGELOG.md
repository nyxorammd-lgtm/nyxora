## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Cobra CLI framework** — Professional command-line interface with subcommands, flag validation, and help system
- **Concurrent transport connections** — All 12 transports connect simultaneously using `errgroup` (reduces connection time from ~24s to ~2s)
- **30-second connection timeout** — Prevents infinite hangs on unresponsive transports
- **Comprehensive unit tests** — 15+ new tests for transport manager with mock transports
- **CI/CD pipeline improvements** — Updated to Go 1.25, added test timeout, race detection
- **Web Dashboard branding** — Updated all HTML files with NYXORA Network branding
- **Organization migration** — Repository moved to `nyxora-network` GitHub Organization

### Changed
- **Module path fixed** — `go.mod` now correctly declares `github.com/nyxora-network/nyxora`
- **CLI architecture** — Replaced manual `os.Args` parsing with `spf13/cobra` v1.10.2
- **Error handling** — All critical paths now use `fmt.Errorf` wrapping with context
- **Go version** — Minimum required Go version updated from 1.24 to 1.25
- **README.md** — Unified professional README with badges, CLI/Web docs, and architecture highlights
- **CI/CD workflows** — Updated `ci.yml` and `release.yml` to Go 1.25
- **All internal URLs** — Updated from `nyxorammd-lgtm` to `nyxora-network` (40+ files)

### Fixed
- **Import path mismatch** — All internal imports now use correct module path
- **Error context loss** — Bare `return err` patterns replaced with wrapped errors
- **CLI flag parsing** — Fixed fragile manual parsing with proper Cobra flag handling

### Removed
- **Legacy CLI parser** — Removed 400+ lines of manual `os.Args` parsing code
